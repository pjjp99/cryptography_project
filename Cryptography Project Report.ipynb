    "Cryptography is defined to be the science or study of the techniques of secret writing, especially code and cipher systems, methods, and the like. In this project we will explore and analyse various encryption methods and their corresponding decryption methods in order to send and receive private messages. We will analyse the time complexities of these methods and also the security implications to reach a conclusion about their efficacy. We will start by considering some basic ciphers, then explore the RSA method - one of the most widely used methods today. We will look at how RSA encryption works, how different elements of it can be constructed and whether it is possible to feasibly break the encryption."

    "The Caesar Cypher is an encryption technique where every letter in a given word is replaced \n",
    "by a letter some fixed distance down the alphabet. The fixed distance is given to us by our encryption key. For example, if the word to be encrypted is '$MathProgram$' and the key is $4$, $M $would shift to $Q$, $a$ to $e$, $t$ to $x$ and so on; leading to the new ciphertext: $QexlTvskveq$. Considering there are only $26$ potentially different encryptions, it is quite a basic cipher rendering it straightforward to crack. However, the encryption step performed by the cipher is integrated into more complex ciphers such as the Affine and Vigenere ciphers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cipher itself has been around for a very long time, dating back to around 100 BC where the Roman ruler Julius Caesar, used the cipher to send secret communications; hence the name 'Caeser Cipher'.\n",
    "\n",
    "To encrypt a message using the Caesar Cipher, we first worked out the order of each letter in the message (producing a string of numbers). Next we added the key to that number and used the reverse-order chr() function to output the new encrypted word. We also still ensured that the encrypted order was that of a letter using some 'wrap-around' techniques that are explained in the code. We finally, ensured that any symbols that aren't alphabetical were left unchanged, and added all of these encrypted symbols to a string and printed the new encrypted word.\n",
    "\n",
    "To decrypt a message, we used a very similar method, but instead we subtracted the key from the order of each character in the message. During encryption we shifted the letters forward so now we are shifting them backwards, hence the subtraction. We then used a very similar 'wrap-around' technique to the encryption code, in order to ensure that the orders of the decrypted characters are still letters. Finally, we outputted this result and left all the symbols that weren't letters unchanged.  "

The list that looks most like sinsible English is the plaintext that was originally encrypted. There are only $26$ possible outputs for the Caesar cipher, showing that it is incredibly vulnerable to cracking and a poor choice of cipher if used for encrypting sensitive information. The small number of potential outputs also makes it simple for the user to spot what the original plaintext was.\n",

Mode $1$ of the function outputs a list of integers corresponding to the position of each letter in the encrypted word with respect to the general alphabet. Mode $2$ then finds the corresponding letter with respect to the alphabet after the integers from mode $1$ have been shifted by the given key. We then defined the 'crack' function, which first uses mode $1$ of the letter_converter function to convert the letters into integers, and then uses a for loop to shift these integers by a key-shift ranging from $1$-$26$. Finally, our function outputs $26$ lists corresponding to each key-shift after using mode 2 of the 'letter_converter' function."

It is also polyalphabetic as it uses at least two cipher alphabets to encrypt the data, i.e. each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a different amount. The Vigenere square (shown below) is used to produce a new letter depending on the pairs. For example if the plaintext to be encrypted is $mathprogram$ and the key is $hadleigh$, then the first letter of plaintext $m$ is the column of the Vigenere square paired up with the first letter of the key $h$ which is the row. This combination outputs $t$; the first letter of this new encryption. If the key does not match the same number of elements as the plaintext then it will loop round. For example, if the plaintext is $mathprogram$ and the key is $hads$, then the key used in practise will actually be $hadshadshad$.\n",

We then add this new number to the original 'num' if encrypting and subtract if decrypting. Next we use the modulo function to ensure that the value for num is between $0$ and the length of 'letters', so that a symbol from 'letters' is outputted. After that we worked out whether the letter is upper or lower case, found the letter corresponding to our new 'num' and added this letter to our list 'alist'.

There are approximately $50000$ words in a common dictionary so it would take a short amount of time for a computer to run through all the words until the correct key is found. By making the ciphered text longer we can increase the time required to crack the cipher but ultimately, the correct key will eventually be found. Therefore, if a dictionary word is used as the key, the Vigenere cipher is not very secure.\n",

   "source": [
    "So far we have seen a crack where the key is an English word from the dictionary however, what would we do if the key is a non-English word?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is a mixture of Kasiski examination and frequency analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first use Kasiski examination to determine the length of the key used to encrypt the text. Then we use frequency analysis to break each of the subkeys independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step of Kasiski examination is to look for repeated sets of at least three letters in the ciphertext. This is because when the plain text is much longer than the key, letters of the key will be used to encode a simple word such as 'the' many times. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "'THEDOGWENTTOTHE...' = MESSAGE\n",
    "\n",
    "'KEYKEYKEYKEYKEY...' = KEY\n",
    "\n",
    "'DLCNSEGILDXMDLC...' = CIPHERTEXT\n",
    "\n",
    "Above we can clearly see how our key is encoding 'the' multiple times producing repeated sequences of letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we must determine the spacing length between the first letters of each two sets of repeated letters. For example, $HTFAKJUFHTF$ will have a potential key length of $8$ since the spacing between both H's is $8$. Now we have many potential key lengths so to narrow this selection down, we choose potential key lengths that are factors of the spacing lengths. Out of all the factors, we choose the most commonly occuring factors because they are most likely the length of the Vigenere key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have the key lengths, we are ready to apply frequency analysis and find each subkey one at a time. Let's say Kasiski analysis gave us key lengths $3$ and $4$. Using a key length of $4$, we now need to produce a string of letters which were ciphered by each of the subkeys. So starting from the first subkey, every fourth letter from there would be encrypted with the first subkey and starting from the second subkey, every fourth letter from there would be encrypted with the second subkey. We can continue this process until we have strings of ciphertext that have each been encrypted with the same subkey.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "'ABCDABCDABCD...' = MESSAGE\n",
    "\n",
    "The string encrypted by the 1st subkey would be 'AAA..'\n",
    "\n",
    "The string encrypted by the 2nd subkey would be 'BBB..'\n",
    "\n",
    "The string encrypted by the 3rd subkey would be 'CCC..'\n",
    "\n",
    "The string encrypted by the 4th subkey would be 'DDD..'\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform frequency analysis we first need a list of letters in order of how frequently they appear in the normal plain text:\n",
    "$$'ETAOINSHRDLCUMWFGYPBVKJXQZ' $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$ETAOIN$ are the $6$ most common letters and $VKJXQZ$ would be the $6$ most uncommon letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by taking each string encrypted by a subkey (eg 'AAA...' encrypyted by 1st subkey as seen above) and decrypt it $26$ times using all $26$ letters of the alphabet. Next we take this decrypted string and order the letters of the alphabet in order of how frequently they appear in the string. We rank the subkeys by how closely the resulting decrypted string matches the letter frequency of English. For each nth letter of the key, we choose the top $4$ letters which produced the highest match score as our potential subkeys.\n",
    "\n",
    "After running frequency analysis with all the different key lengths we gathered from Kasiski analysis, we have enough to test actual keys. Using all the possible subkeys and key lengths, we generate all possible keys and test them in our decryption function with the ciphertext. The resulting ciphertext is run through a function which determines if the individual words of the ciphertext match English words from the dictionary. If there are enough matches, the key is deemed to be the correct key and the deciphered message is printed to the attacker.\n",

    "\n",
    "In general, without any statistical or computational techniques, the only method to break the Vigenere cipher is by brute force. When the key length increases by one character, the maximum number of possible keys we have to try increases by a factor of $26$. Thus we can claim that the time complexity in a brute force method is $ O(26^k) $ where $k$ is the length of the key. Hence longer keys are more secure against a brute force attack. \n",
    "\n",
    "For our frequency analysis method, the effectiveness of the crack can be limited in a few ways. The maximum length of key we test for is $16$ because keys longer than this require much greater time and computing power to find. Hence we can claim that a longer key is more secure. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also know that the shorter the message is the less effective frequency analysis is. This is because we would not have enough characters in our message to spot frequent appearances of common letters. We can generalise this to say that the closer the key and message are in length, the harder the cipher is to crack. Since the key is the length of the message, we cannot perform frequency analysis since each subkey only ciphers one letter of the message. However if the message and key are both very short, ($<8$ characters) the cipher is vulnerable to a brute force crack. If the key is random then the cipher becomes theoretically unbreakable because the same length key and message essentially becomes a one time pad.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the message is much longer than the key, then due to Krasiski analysis we can spot patterns in the ciphertext allowing us to deduce the key length. Then we can apply frequency analysis testing all possible subkeys and analysing the resulting text to see if its resulting letter frequency is consistent with English text. Therefore a message much longer than the key is not very secure since it can be easily cracked. However, if the message was not in English, an attacker would not be able to apply frequency analysis so the only option to hacking it is by brute force. Since brute force is normally not viable, we can claim that non-English text is cryptographically secure. \n",
    "\n",
    "One final security flaw remains which is the Vigenere's vulnerability to key elimination. Since the Vigenere cipher uses modulo arithmetic, which is commutative, key elimination can prove an effective way at cracking short messages. If the key length is known then we can subtract the cipher text from itself, producing plain text encrypted in itself. The self encryption can be cracked if a common word can be recognised. Finally, we can extract the key by extracting the known plain text. "

    "This section is based on ideas in [8].\n",
    "\n",
    "The Affine Cipher is another way of encrypting data. It is a monoalphabetic technique, whereby each letter in the original message is converted to an integer using a simple function, and then converted back to a letter. Similarly to the Caesar cipher, every letter is encrypted by one other letter, making it a standard substitution cipher. However, this makes it vulnerable to cracking as every letter is encrypted using the same function. Potentially making it easy to spot a trend within the coded phrase and thus cracking the cipher.\n",

    "The function used to encrypt the message is \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "E(x) = (ax + b) \\bmod m, \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $a$ and $b$ are the keys of the cipher and $m$ is the size of the alphabet (in our case 26). We also must have that $a$ and $m$ are coprime, i.e. gcd($a,m$) $= 1$. This is because the decryption function, $D(x)$, is \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "D(x) = a^{-1}(x - b) \\bmod m, \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $a^{-1}$ is the multiplicative inverse of $a$, i.e. $1 = a^{-1}a$ (mod $m$), which exists only if gcd($a, m$) $= 1$.\n",
    "We can prove that this has to be the case by decrypting the encryption function, i.e. apply $D(x)$ to $E(x)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "D(E(x)) &= a^{-1}(E(x)-b)\\bmod{m}\\\\\n",

    "We now know that the Caesar cipher is just the Affine cipher but with $a = 1$, since  the Caesar cipher is just a linear swap. This means that the Affine cipher inherits similar weaknesses, making it very vulnerable to hacking. We can calculate using the regular $26$-letter alphabet, how many total affine ciphers there are. We find that there are 12 numbers that are less than and coprime to $26$, meaning that there are $12$ possible values of $a$. Therefore the total number of potential affine ciphers is $12$ x $26 = 312$, which is a lot more than the Caeser cipher, but around $1,000,000$ times fewer than the Vigenere cipher. In practise, the Affine Cipher is not often used because of its security vulnerabilities as it is just a slight adaptation of the Caeser cipher.\n",

    "To encrypt a message, we first defined functions for the greatest common divisor and modular inverse. We then defined a function designed for the key, that returns $key1$ - the quotient of the key with respect to the length of the 'symbols' set, then $key2$ - the remainder, modulo (length of the 'symbols' set). Next we created a function that checks for key inputs that either don't work or output a weak encrypted text. For example, $key1$ and length of the 'symbols' set ($len(symbols$)) have to be coprime so the function checks for that. We also have that if $key1 = 0$ then the outputted text is unchanged and so we relay this information onto the user. We used the given function, $C = (aT + b)$ mod $len(symbols)$, to return the index of the new encrypted symbol where $a$ = $key1$, $b$ = $key2$ and $T$ is the index of each symbol in the original message with respect to the 'symbols' set. We then used this index to return the corresponding symbol in 'symbols' and added that character to the new encrypted text. We repeated this process until all of the characters from the user's input message had been encrypted.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To decrypt a message, we used a very similar approach to the encryption process however we used the decryption function instead of the encryption function. We first used the multiplicative inverse function that we defined at the start. We assigned a variable $modInverseKey1$ to the value of the modular inverse of $key1$ with respect to $len(symbols)$. We then used the formula $T = a^{-1}(C - b)$ mod $len(symbols)$ to return the index for each character in the new decrypted message. We define $a$ = $key1$, $b$ = $key2$ and $C$ to be the index of each character in the encrypted message with respect to the 'symbols' set. We finally used this index to return the corresponding symbol in 'symbols' and added that character to the new decrypted text. We repeated this process until all the characters had been decrypted. \n"

The user can choose if they are happy that the message given is the correct decryption or try more potential keys. The brute-force approach is implemented by using the 'affine_decrypt' function that I made previously and outputting lots of messages by using every possible key as an input.\n",

    "\n",
    "When sending a physical letter or document to a recipient, common practice is to sign the document so the recipient knows that the document is authentic. However, the envelope may be intercepted along the way or the signature may be forged causing the document to potentially contain false information. When sending this document online, we need a method to show that the message is from the original sender (it is authentic) and hasn't been tampered with.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method we use is to create a hash value of the message and send it to the recipient via the RSA protocol. A hash function assigns a unique value to the message sent in such a way that if one character of the message was changed, the hash function would be completely different; this is known as the avalanche effect. The resulting hash value is encrypted via the RSA alogrithm and sent together with the encrypted messaged to the recipient. The recipient decrypts both the hash and the encrypted message first, and subsequently passes the decrypted message through the hash function. By comparing the new hash value and the one sent with the encrypted message, it is possible to see if the message has been tampered with or not. If the two hash values agree, the message is authentic, but if they are not equal then we know that the message has been tampered with."

    "\n",
    "The standard of hash functions is continually improved to prevent hackers from obtaining sensitive material and protect the integrity of the information being transmitted. Therefore,  the ideal cryptographic hash function must have the following required main properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It must be deterministic.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the same message must always produce the same hash value. This is highly important since it allows the decrypted message to be checked at the end. If the same message did not produce the same hash value, we would have no way of knowing if the message that been tampered with or not\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It is quick to compute the hash value for any message\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashing must be efficient so that a hash value is computed in a time long enough not to comprimise the security of the message but short enough so that people will actually use said hash function. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. It is infeasible to create a message with an intended hash value\n",
    "\n",
    "Since a hash function is a one way function which is near enough impossible to invert, the only way of creating a message which yields a given hash value is by a brute force search. This is both impractical and extremely time consuming thus, protecting the uniqueness of each hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. It is infeasible to find two different messages with the same hash value\n",
    "\n",
    "A hash function that is too fast runs the risk of being susceptible to the collision effect. This is where two different documents can produce the same hash value: MD5 is an example of a popular hash function which contains this flaw. The main issue with this is that a hacker could potentially intercept the message, interchange the message with their own and the recipient would have no way of knowing that the message is authentic since the hash values are the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The avalanche effect \n",
    "\n",
    "When any character of the message is changed, the resulting hash value should change so extensively that the new value should seem uncorrelated with the old value. This stops the hacker from attempting to find two different messages with the same value\n",

    "The RSA Encryption protocol is an asymmetric form on internet encryption used for secure data transmission. In this cryptosystem, there is a public key used by the sender to encrypt the message and a private key used by the recipient to decrypt it. The public key $(N,e)$ contains $N$, the product of two large primes $ p$ and $q$, and $e$ which we call the exponent. Normally the number $e = 65537$ is used and it can be repeatedly used by different people without comprising security. Moreover, the private key $(p,q)$ contains just $p$ and $q$ which can be multiplied together to get $N$. The asymmetry stems from the practical difficulty in factoring $N$ into $p$ and $q$ hence $N$ is avaliable to anyone without a security risk: this is known as the factoring problem. However, it is vital that $p$ and $q$ are not used by different people so we generate new random primes $p$ and $q$ each time we send a message."

    "## Security\n",
    "\n",
    "For a hash function to be considered secure, there are three specific security properties it must satisfy for it to be resistance to attacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first one is pre-image resistance. This property ensures that with any given output, it is not possible to recover the input. This one way property is similar to baking a cake since the ingredients of the cake cannot be recovered once the cake is cooked. However, there is still the possibility of a brute force attack so to ensure that this does not happen, the output should be more than $128$ bits. Once the output is of this length, it becomes very difficult to perform a brute force attack so we consider the hash secure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second one is second pre-image resistance. The property states that if given a specific input and output, you should not be able to find a different input that hashes to the same digest. This is also known as the weak collision resistance. In order to prevent second pre image resistance, the output must be more than $128$ bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the third property is collision-resistance. It should be hard to produce two different inputs that hash to the same output. MD5 is very vulnerable to collisions so the use of this hash function in data transmission is being phased out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, there is an infinite number of inputs that hash to the same output so the smaller the number of bits in the hash, the greater the number of inputs which map to the same hash. Hence, the minimum output size which a hash function must produce is $256$ bits in order for collisions to be considered out of reach. However, a common attack which attempts to produce collisions is called the birthday attack. It tries to find two different inputs which yield the same hash and has a time complexity of $2^{n/2}$ where n is number of bits."

    "\n",
    "Time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. It is commonly estimated by counting the number of operations in the algorithm on an input of size n whilst assuming that each operation takes the same amount of time. The best attack on MD5 produced a collision in $2^{18}$ time however we commonly express time complexity as a function of the input size using big $O$ notation. For example, MD5 and SHA-256 both have a time complexity of $O(n)$ itself.\n",
    "\n",

An extremely selective institution, it has an average of 6.4 (Sciences faculty) to 13.1 (Medicine & Dentistry Faculty) applicants for each undergraduate place.[17] It was ranked 9th in the UK among multi-faculty institutions for the quality (GPA) of its research[18] and for its Research Power in the 2014 Research Excellence Framework.[19] Current academics include 21 fellows of the Academy of Medical Sciences, 13 fellows of the British Academy, 13 fellows of the Royal Academy of Engineering and 44 fellows of the Royal Society.[20] The university has been associated with 13 Nobel laureates throughout its history, including Paul Dirac, Sir William Ramsay, Cecil Frank Powell, Sir Winston Churchill, Dorothy Hodgkin, Hans Albrecht Bethe, Max Delbrück, Gerhard Herzberg, Sir Nevill Francis Mott, Sir Paul Nurse, Harold Pinter, Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio and most recently, 2015 Economics Nobel Prize winner Angus Deaton. Bristol is a member of the Russell Group of research-intensive British universities,[21] the European-wide Coimbra Group[22] and the Worldwide Universities Network, of which the university's previous vice-chancellor, Eric Thomas, was chairman from 2005 to 2007.[23] In addition, the university holds an Erasmus Charter, sending more than 500 students per year to partner institutions in Europe.\"\n",

    "## Security Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is based on ideas in [15] and [16].\n",
    "\n",
    "We have been asked to discuss the security implications regarding this manner of proceeding and investigate other possible ways of dealing with longer messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "RSA remains secure due to the difficulty in factoring $N$ into the product of its two secretive large primes. This problem is known as the integer factorisation problem which is considered infeasible in polynomial time. If a message was intercepted, the attackers would have to computing $\\phi(N)$ to see the message. To do this requires you to solve the integer factorisation problem, which is infeasible because $N$ is very large.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time complexity is most commonly determined by considering the total number of operations performed by the system where each operation takes a fixed unit of time. We normally express time complexity as a function of the input size. In this instance, the input size is the length of the private key which we will denote as $n$. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the length of the private key increases, the increase in time is non-linear and exponential in relation to the length of the private key. Hence the time complexity of the RSA algorithm is $O(n^2).$\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Nevertheless, this encryption method is not one hundred percent secure, and as mentioned in the lecture notes, should someone get hold of the ciphertext $c$ then there is a possiblity they could also obtain $f$ and thus be able to decrpyt the message. In order to do this, as stated, someone would need to compute $\\phi(N)$. Although this is hugely difficult, it is not impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, there is another issue. This is the fact that we use the same public and private keys for every string we encrypt and decrypt. Changing this would be very complex, but would be useful in creasing the strength of security when coding a large message. Should someone be able to decyrpt one of the strings, it would be equally as hard to encrypt them all due to the different keys used and as such would take a significant amount of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to improve security could be that once the text has been broken down into a list, the order could be jumbled and as such if someone were to access the list, it would not be immediatly clear what the message is. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, when doing research into the RSA method, it has been stated that it has not been mathematically proven that the only way to determine the message from the cihper text and public key is by facoring the public key. So there is the question of whether another method could be discovered in the future which makes finding $N$ a lot quicker. \n",
    "\n",
    "There have been a lot of challenges set to the public to break into the RSA method and obtain the message. There is one such case where a sucessful team managed to crack a $512$ bit $N$ value, but it took five months, eleven different locations and two hundred and ninety three different computers. So, arguably, the current methods used are incredibly slow and ineffective thus making the RSA method very secure at the moment. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is also the most widely used key cryptosystem in the world and so we must not be too critical of the security risks; they are miniscule and thus the reason for why it is such a valuable cryptography method."

Using this relationship, we can calculate, approximately, how many seconds it will take to factorise $N=pq$ for any bit-length. Thus, we can decide when it will be unfeasible to factorise $N$ in such a manner."

    "For integer factorisation to pose a threat to the security RSA encryption, the factorisation must be able to be computed quickly. Since each pair of primes are randomly generated and used only once, it is clear that the primes serve no purpose to an attacker if the factorisation algorithm is only complete $500$ hours after the message is sent. Data from our decompose function shows that with integers greater than $50$ digits, factorisation could potentially take hundreds of hours. RSA encrypted typically employs a key size $1,024$ or $2,048$ or $4,096$ bits where $1024$ bits translates to $309$ digits. Clearly, our decompose function is not equipped to factorise an RSA key to produce primes in a short enough time to pose a threat to security.\n",
    "\n",
    "The integer factorisation problem poses great significance in the mathematical and computing communities and thus more intricate methods have been developed to factorise $N$. Since our decompose function struggles with number larger than $37$ bits, mathematicians have implemented a highly optimised general number field sieve which runs on hundreds of machines. In February 2020, an $829$ bits, $250$ decimal digit number was factored; the largest such semi-prime yet. The total computation time was roughly $2700$ core-years of computing, highlighting the fact that although large numbers can be factored, the time taken is too great to pose a threat to RSA.\n",
    "\n",
    "No algorithm has been published that can factor all integers in polynomial time so we cannot assign the integer factorisation problem a definitive time complexity measure. However, for $n$ bit numbers the time taken for factorisation increases non-linearly and exponentially. Therefore we can claim that the time complexity is $O(n^k)$ where $n$ is the number of bits and $k$ is a constant yet to be determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem does not yet have any efficient way of finding two prime factors for large semi-primes so clearly our problem is in the class NP. However, it has not been proved whether it is or isn't NP complete but it is generally suspected that it isn't."

    "Pollard's Rho method is another method used to factorise large integers. Suppose we have $N = pq$ where $p$ and $q$ are prime numbers. Since we do not know $p$ and $q$, we wish to factorise $N$ in order to find them. Firstly, we select $k$ numbers in a random manner to get a sequence $x_1,x_2,...,x_k$ such that for each $x_i$, where $i \\in [1,k]$, we have that $x_i \\in [0,N-1]$. We make the assumption that all of the numbers are distinct, which is likely if $N$ is a lot larger than $k$. As long as we select $k$ reasonably, we have an extremely high probability that the following holds: $$\\text{For some } i,j \\in [1,k], \\text{ we have that } x_{i} \\equiv x_{j} \\mod{p}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is true due to the Birthday Paradox and is explored in further detail here***. Thus, we have that $p|x_{i}-x_{j}$ and $p|N$ and thus we have that $p|\\gcd(x_{i}-x_{j},N).$ Furthermore, since $-N\\leq x_{i}-x_{j} \\leq N$ and $x_{i} \\neq x_{j}$, we have that $\\gcd(x_{i}-x_{j},N) \\leq N$. Thus $\\gcd(x_{i}-x_{j},N)$ is a non-trivial factor of $N$ and hence we can use this to find $p$ and $q$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier, we mentioned that we must pick $k$ 'reasonably'. We have that $k \\approx \\sqrt{p}$ is a reasonable choice and since $p\\leq \\sqrt{N}$, we have that $k \\approx N^{\\frac{1}{4}}$ is what we will usually select. This is because $p$ is unknown. Furthermore, the most important part of the Pollard-Rho method is to pick the sequence $x_1,x_2,...,x_k$ in a pseudo-random fashion. We have that the function $f(x) = x^{2} + 1 \\mod{N}$ can be used to create a pseudo-random sequence by letting $x_{i} = f(x_{i-1})$ where $x_{0}$ is some chosen constant. It has been proven empirically that this sequence using the defined function will create a pseudo-random sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, since we are assuming that there exists some $i,j \\in [1,k]$ such that $x_i \\equiv x_j \\mod{p}$, we have that $f(x_i)\\equiv f(x_j) \\mod{p}$ and thus $x_{i+1} \\equiv x_{j+1}$. Since this process continues, we have that eventually the sequence of $x_{0}\\mod{p},x_{1}\\mod{p},...$ will 'run into itself' and loop around before then, continuing in a cycle. This idea when plotted form the shape of a $\\rho$ and is what gives the method its name. More importantly, however, is that this means we can make the entire process more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "To take advantage of the fact that the sequence will eventually start to repeat in a loop, we use this idea of the 'tortoise and hare' algorithm. In other words, we choose  constant $x_0 = y_0$ as before and let the 'tortoise' be represented by $x_i = f(x_{i-1})$ whilst the 'hare' is represented by $y_i = f(f(y_{i-1}))$. Thus we have the $x_i$'s compute the sequence at a normal pace whilst the $y_i$'s compute the sequence at twice the speed. Thus, we will quickly be able to determine where the loop in the sequence is as the $y_i$'s will eventually 'catch-up' with the $x_i$'s and start repeating the 'tortoise' sequence. Thus, as soon as $\\gcd(x_i-y_i,N) \\neq 1$, we have found our factor and we can return it. Since $N = pq$ and $p$,$q$ are prime, we have that the factor returned will be equal to either $p$ or $q$ and thus we have factorised $N$."

    "As we can see from the dataframe above, we have that the pollard_rho function is a lot faster than the decompose function for factorising large $N = pq$ where $p$ and $q$ are prime numbers. We have that in some cases, the speed of pollard_rho is more than $100$ times faster than that of decompose. For example, for a $N$ bit-length of $50$, we have that decompose took on average $5.726562$ seconds, to $6$ decimal places, to factorise $N$ whereas pollard_rho took only $0.039062$ seconds, to $6$ decimal places. Furthermore, it can also be seen that the times for pollard_rho are more erratic than those of decompose. For example, the pollard_rho times frequently deviate from a pattern altough they do have the general trend of increasing as the bit-length increases. We can see this as from bit-lengths $40$ to $50$, we see the time taken by the pollard_rho function increase from $0.003906$ to $0.039062$. However, there is also deviation as a bit-length of $49$ gave an average time of $0.054688$ which is larger than the time taken for the bit-length of $50$. This can probably be explained due to the number of trials done being relatively small and therefore some of the measurements may not be as accurate. On the other hand, the decompose function is much more regular and the time taken steadily rises as the bit-length of $N$ does, in a much more obvious fashion."

We have that this is based on the ideas of the Birthday Paradox which heavily influence the ideas behind Pollard's Rho Method. We have that the Birthday Paradox suggests that a group of $23$ people is a large enough group to ensure that in $50\\%$ of cases, two people in such a group share the same birthday. This idea can be developed to suggest that upon picking numbers randomly from a set containing $p$ numbers, we have that the probability of picking a particular number exceed $50\\%$ when $1.177 \\cdot \\sqrt{p}$ numbers have been picked. However, this really applies to Pollard's theoretical method where actual random numbers are used. In reality, pseudo-random numbers are used.

    "Another method to factorise large integers was also invented by Pollard in 1974, the year before he invented his Rho Method. It is called Pollard's P-1 Algorithm. The algorithm uses Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that for prime $p$ and integer $a$, such that $p \\nmid a$, we have that $$a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\mod{p}.$$\n",

    "The method entails selecting suitably large numbers, say $M$, such that we hope that for a prime factor of $N$, denoted $p$, we have that $p-1\\mid M.$ Thus, we have that for some constant integer $k$, $M = k(p-1).$ Hence, by Fermat's Little Theorem, we have that for some $a$ co-prime to $N$, we have that $$a^{M} = a^{k(p-1)} = (a^{p-1})^{k} \\equiv 1^{k} = 1 \\mod{p}.$$\n",

    "Furthermore, we have by the Division Theorem that for some $b$ and $r$, we have that $M = b(q - 1) + r$, where $0 \\leq r < q-1.$ Thus we have by The Division Theorem and Fermat's Little Theorem that $$a^{M} = a^{b(q-1) + r} = (a^{q-1})^{b}a^{k} \\equiv 1^{b}a^{k} = a^{k} \\mod  q.$$\n",

In the latter, we have that we can go back to the start of the algorithm and pick another $a$ and repeat the process whilst hoping that this time we get a non-trivial factor. Wheras, with the former, we have that $q-1 \\mid M$ and this is problematic. Thus, in this case we would want to select a new $M$ such that $q-1 \\nmid M$.\n",

However, the algorithm itself does have some downfalls, as mentioned earlier, and is dependent on the choice of $B$ chosen, among other things. Furthermore, the memory needed for such a function means that as $N$ starts to get even larger, the method becomes unfeasible. The method is relatively quick when $p-1$ has a lot of factors but this is not always the case. Therefore, as $N$ gets a lot larger, we have that this method becomes unfeasible and thus pales in comparison to more powerful methods we have already discussed such as the decompose function and Pollard's Rho Method. Hence, this method would not be very effective in use and is also relatively slow in comparison to the others as well as not working all of the time."

    "Dixon's Factorisation Method is an algorithm invented by John Dixon and published in 1981. Although it is not the fastest method for factorising large integers, it is the precursor to more modern methods such as the Quadratic Sieve Method and the General Number Field Sieve which are considered to be the fastest two methods for factorising smaller and larger integers respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dixon's method consists of first selecting a bound $B$. It is from this bound $B$, that we assemble a list of primes to be our factor base: a small set of prime numbers which we can factorise integers over. So, our base consists of all primes $p$ such that $p \\leq B$. We call this set $P$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we find $\\lceil\\sqrt{N}\\rceil$, the ceiling of the square root of $N$. This allows us a start point to begin our search at. We only have to check from $\\lceil\\sqrt{N}\\rceil$ to $N$ itself because an two distinct factors of $N$,say $p$ and $q$, have the property that either $p \\geq \\sqrt{N}$ or $q \\geq \\sqrt{N}$. Thus there will always exist one factor of $N$ in the range $[\\lceil\\sqrt{N}\\rceil, N]$. Of course, if $N = p^2$ for some $p$, then we check this first and act accordingly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Presuming that $N$ has two distinct factors, we start finding $z^{2} \\mod N$ for each $z \\in [\\lceil\\sqrt{N}\\rceil, N]$. We then collect all those $z$ such that they are considered $B-smooth$. That is, all $z$ such that  $z^{2} \\mod N$ can be written as $\\prod_{p_{i} \\in P}{p_{i}^{a_i}}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We store all such $z$ that are $B-smooth$ as well as vectors $a = (a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{k})$ where each $a_i$, for $i \\in [1,k]$ where $k$ is the number of primes in $P$, is the exponent of prime $p_i$ in the prime factorisation of the previously calculated $z^{2} \\mod N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we now have two lists: a list of $B-smooth$ $z$ values and a corresponding list of exponents of the prime factorisations. We shall call these lists $Z$ and $A$ respectively. We continue to collect $z$ values and $a$ vectors to our list until we have slightly more values than the number of primes in $P$. This will give us a high probability of finding a factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, Dixon's Method suggests we go through $A$ and find the first vector $a \\in A$ which is linearly dependent on previous vectors. We denote this vector $c$. We then remove $c$ and its corresponding $z$ value, denoted $z_{c}$, from the lists $A$ and $Z$ respectively. We then compute coefficients $f_a$, which are either $1$ or $0$, such that $$c \\equiv \\sum_{a \\in A}{f_{a}a} \\mod 2. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we let $d = (d_1,d_2,...,d_k) = \\frac{1}{2}(c + \\sum_{a \\in A}{f_{a}a})$. Penultimately, we define $x = z_{c}\\prod_{a}{z_{a}^{f_a}}$, where $z_a$ are the $z$ values related to the vectors $a$, and $y = \\prod_{i}{p_{i}^{d_i}}$. Thus we have that $x^{2} \\equiv y^{2} \\mod N$. Now, if $x \\equiv y \\mod N$ or $x \\equiv -y \\mod N$, then the algorithm has failed and it should be repeated with a new value for $B$. However, this is rare and almost always we will have no such case and thus $gcd(x + y, N)$ will return a non-trivial factor of $N$."

    "The Diffie-Hellman protocol is a way of privately exchanging a shared secret between two parties. The process starts with two parties/people (Alice and Bob) sharing publicly a large (in our case, 256-bit) prime number, $p$, and a primitive root (base), $g$, such that $g^{p-1}$ $\\equiv1$ (mod $p$) and $g^{t}$ $\\neq$ $1$ (mod $p$) for all $0 < t < p − 1$. Alice and Bob also seperately and privately choose their own large (256-bit) numbers. Alice then publically sends Bob the number $A = g^{a}$ (mod $p$) and Bob publically sends Alice $B = g^{b}$ (mod $p$). Alice then computes the shared secret $S = B^{a}$ (mod $p$) which should be the same as Bob computing the shared secret $S = A^{b}$ (mod $p$). Hence both Alice and Bob are in possession of the secret key $S$. After all parties are in possession of the secret key $S$, they are able to send each other messages and decrypt the messages that they receive from each other.  \n",

The Baby Step is as follows; we firstly need to find the square root of $p-1$ and take the ceiling value of this, which is to round up the value. We then generate a table of values, labelled x, of $g^i mod p$ where by $i$ is in the range 0 to $N$ where $N$ is the ceiling of $\\sqrt{p-1}$. Once this table has been generated we then compute our c value which is $g^{N(p-2)} mod p$.\n",
    "We then compute the Giant Step. To do this we generate values of $M^{c^j mod p} mod p$, where $j$ ranges from 0 to $N$, which we label as $y$ and then search for the point in $x$ such that $y=x$. When we find this point we then calculate $a$ which is $j(N)+x[y]$ where $x[y]$ is the location of $y$ in the table $x$ and $j$ is the counter value for when $y$ was in $x$.\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we have shown various approaches to encryption and decryption and delved into the security implications involved. We have discussed how these methods have changed over times as well as some of the modern day usages of them. We have considered some basic ciphers such as the Caesar, Vigenere and Affine Ciphers and showed how these can be easily broken. We then considered one of the most widely used encryption methods today: RSA. We showed how such a method can be implemented and also how to break such a method can be incredibly time-consuming. We looked at some different methods for attempting to break such a method including Pollard's Rho Method and Dixon's Factorisation Algorithm, although all were found to be inneffective and virtually useless when considering the size of primes used in RSA encryption. Thus, we came to the conclusion that such an encryption method is incredibly secure. We also examined the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange and looked at how effective such a method can be with regards to encryption and decryption. Overall, this project has highlighted some strengths in modern day cryptography whilst also showing, using mathematical programming, how one may attempt to decipher messages encrypted in such a fashion using the aid of such tools as Python.
